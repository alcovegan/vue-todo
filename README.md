# vue-todo

> A Vue.js project

I made it just because i have never done basic todo apps before. Now i'm in business too.

It's basic todo app with localstorage synchronization (throug vuex plugin vuex-persistedstate).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
